This Custom Password Generator is a Java Swing-based GUI application that allows users to generate secure and customizable passwords with letters (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9), and symbols (!@#$%^&*), ensuring strong password security. Users can specify the length (5-16 characters), regenerate passwords if unsatisfied, and copy them to the clipboard with a single click. Built with Java Swing and SecureRandom, the application provides real-time validation, error handling, and a user-friendly interface. Future enhancements include dark mode, password history, and user preferences for an improved experience.
